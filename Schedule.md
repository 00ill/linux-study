# Embedded Linux & OS Master Roadmap (6-Month Schedule)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Master Linux CLI and build practical development environment
- Learn Linux system programming in C
- Develop kernel modules and device drivers
- Compare and experiment with RTOS vs Linux
- Complete a solid portfolio repository

---

## ðŸ“… 6-Month Curriculum

### Month 1: Linux CLI & Environment Basics

- Practice 50 essential Linux commands (files, processes, network)
- Configure shell environment (alias, tmux) + write practical scripts
- Learn and practice systemd service creation and automation
- **Mini-Project**: Develop practical shell scripts & automation tools â†’ Publish on GitHub

---

### Month 2: Linux System Programming (C)

- File I/O, process management, fork/exec/pipe, signal handling, pthreads
- **Mini-Projects**:
  - Create a mini top-like utility reading /proc data
  - Create a mini netcat-like socket communication tool
- Organize Makefiles and package a small utility collection ("mini-busybox")

---

### Month 3: Kernel Module Development

- Write a Hello World kernel module, load/unload with insmod/rmmod, check dmesg logs
- Use module parameters and printk with various log levels
- Register entries in procfs/sysfs for user-kernel communication
- Practice kernel timers and workqueues
- **Mini-Project**: Organize kernel modules repository (from Hello World to sysfs)

---

### Month 4: Device Driver Development

- Develop GPIO/LED and button interrupt drivers
- Write I2C/SPI sensor drivers (e.g., MPU6050)
- Practice platform_driver and Device Tree Overlay usage
- **Mini-Project**: Test drivers on Raspberry Pi with user space test applications

---

### Month 5: RTOS vs Linux Comparison & Practice

- Setup FreeRTOS board/emulator; practice LED, UART, and button handling
- Cross-compile Linux kernel for embedded boards and rebuild
- Learn and apply Yocto-based root filesystem builds
- **Mini-Project**: Document and demonstrate FreeRTOS vs Linux behavior comparison (videos and write-ups)

---

### Month 6: Advanced CLI, CI/CD, and Collaboration

- Analyze performance using perf, ftrace, sysdig tools
- Automate kernel module build and testing with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Learn and adopt git workflows and prepare for open-source contributions
- **Final Portfolio**:
  - mini-busybox utility collection
  - kernel modules repository
  - device driver repository
  - FreeRTOS vs Linux practical reports
  - CI/CD automation scripts and workflows

---
